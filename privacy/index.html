<p class="title">Information Collection and Use</p>
<p>We collect and use your information below to provide our Services.</p>
<p>Share, Re-post & Settings: Our Services are primarily designed to help you share your Instagram’s albums with the world. Most of the information you provide us is information you are asking us to make public. This includes not only your photos or videos under your Instagram’s account and the metadata provided with <em>Meet The World</em>, such as when you re-post or share your Instagram photo album, and many other bits of information that result from your use of the Services. We may use this information to customize the content we show you, including advertisements or our promotions. Our default setting is almost always to make the information you provide public for as long as you do not delete it from <em>Meet The World</em>, but we generally give you settings to make the information more private if you want. Our Services broadly and instantly disseminate your public information to a wide range of users, customers, and services. When you share information or content like photos, videos, and links via the Services, you should think carefully about what you are making public.</p>

<p><span class="title">Location Information</span>: We may use other data from your device to determine location, for example, information about wireless networks or cell towers near your mobile device, or your IP address. We may use and store information about your location to provide features of our Services to improve and customize the Services, for example, with more relevant content like local trends, stories, ads, and suggestions for people to follow.
